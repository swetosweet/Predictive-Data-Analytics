LIFE EXPECTANCY 
===============

Studies have been conducted in the past on several factors affecting Life Expectancy. Some feature was never considered before to predict the accuracy of 
expectancy of life across all countries based upon country status (developing/developed, GDP, Percentage Expenditure), LifeStyle (BMI, Alcohol, Schooling, Income composition of resources),
Diseases (HIV/AIDS, Diptheria, etc)

Data set has been collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). I have done this project on R and the different type of meaningful visualization 
have been created on Tableau. Cleaned data, visualized data, scaled features , analysed statistically, created corelation matrix, checked how variables are positively/negatively corelated with each other 
and how relevant are those, created simple (one variable) regression model with every feature and comparing the p-value of this with multi-variable linear regression to check the redundant predictors,
used vif to quantify the degree of collinearity, checked the conditions if these cleaned data set will be fit for linear regression model, generated the multiple regression model, used both AIC and backward elimination method 
to predict the most accurate model and how to predict in future - was part of this project
